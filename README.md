# Gadget_Finder
This basic program allows you to select your desired gadget from a range of shops, and basic functionalities like sorting according to an attribute or finding a particular shop.

Functions to be supported : List, List by, Add, Find.

Attributes for each Shop : Name, Gadget type, Average Price, Rating(on 5 Stars)

Any suggestions for improvement is always welcome. And most importantly, I would like to be helped to write out this README.md file according to standard conventions.
